## Description
Iâ€™m trying to add some configuration that may not be fully covered in the book

## Some Notes
in chapter 1 you need a pv for creating pvc that not written in the book so i recommend you to read https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner if you wanna  run pv on single worker node
