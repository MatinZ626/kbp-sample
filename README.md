# Kubernetes Best Practices (2nd Edition) 

## Description
I add full Chapter1 k8s config that not exist in main repo.

## Some Notes
in chapter 1 you need a pv for creating pvc that not written in the book so i recommend you to read https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner if you wanna  run pv on single worker node
